## Notes
Challenges I encountered:
- Shift in the syntax from python to Javascript was challenging, as I was totally used to writing code in python.
- Learnt that filter function does not work if {} are not used in the arrow function.
- Writing javascript using `` while using ternary operator within the quotes was challenging, but I was able to figure it out in the end.
- Unable to reproduce Destruction of JSON object as intructed in the Challenge.
